Create a class called SavingsAccount that represents an actual savings account in a bank.
It has two properties: funds and rate_of_interest.
The class should also have a method called debit() that decreases the funds by the specified amount and
a method called credit() that adds to the existing balance.
Also, define a third method to transfer the interest amount to the savings account.
