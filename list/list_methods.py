"""
What is Append in Python?

Pythonâ€™s append() function inserts a single element into an existing list. 
The element will be added to the end of the old list rather than being returned to a new list. 
Adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. 
The length of the list increases by one. 

Syntax:  list.append(item)
